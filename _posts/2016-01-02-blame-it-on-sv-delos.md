SV Delos is to blame...  And my brother, who first showed me the SV Delos youtube channel.  He was intrigued by their story, and About 2 months ago he made me watch one of their episodes.  I think it was this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-896fMbjqQ

Within days I watched every single episode of theirs.  It had changed me.  It took me a week or so to slowly work the word "sailing" into a conversation with my wife.  I'm not one to tempt fate, and I'm a bit superstitious, so it's not like me to make statements like I'm about to.

> I am going to buy a sailboat and sail around the world.

Ok, I'll admit it too - even I think I'm crazy.  This blog is anonymous for a reason.  There's a shit-ton of things that need to happen before I can get started, the first being convincing my wife.

This blog is going to be my outlet of this secret journey.  Someday I hope to be able to put my name all over it, but for now it's just a crazy all-consuming sickness.  I hope to meet others like me on the way - I suspect there are many of us.
